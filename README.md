# QR Scan with SF's Design System

Scan QR code from SF Account ID and SOQL query account where ID = decoded barcode using JavaScript remoting
and SF's Design System UI.

Please contact [Jamie](mailto:jamie.smith@coastalcloud.us) with feedback / Q's.

#### Things needed

I'll push static resources needed which has Design System @ v1.0.2. You can find [Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/resources/downloads/)
by following that link and you can choose to use their unmanaged package or npm, etc. You'll just need to update the static resource
reference in the page (hopefully).
